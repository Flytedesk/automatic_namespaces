# AutomaticNamespaces

This gem eases some pain related to strong namespaces in a modular monolith. 

By default, Rails 7 autoloader (Zeitwerk) requires a separate "namespace" directory above a namespaced class. For example:

```
app
├── models
│   ├── component1
│   │   ├── class1.rb       # contains Component1::Class1
```

When building a modular monolith using packages ([packwerk](https://github.com/Shopify/packwerk) + [packs-rails](https://github.com/rubyatscale/packs-rails)), 
this pattern creates a lot of extra noise in the directory structure:

```
packs
├── component1
│   ├── app
│   │   ├── controllers
│   │   │   ├── component1
│   │   │   │   ├── model1_controller.rb  # contains Component1::Model1Controller
│   │   │   │   ├── model2_controller.rb  # contains Component1::Model2Controller
│   │   ├── models
│   │   │   ├── component1
│   │   │   │   ├── model1.rb             # contains Component1::Model1
│   │   │   │   ├── model2.rb             # contains Component1::Model2
│   │   ├── public
│   │   │   ├── component1
│   │   │   │   ├── public_type1.rb       # contains Component1::PublicType1
│   │   │   │   ├── public_type2.rb       # contains Component1::PublicType2
│   │   ├── services
│   │   │   ├── component1
│   │   │   │   ├── service1.rb           # contains Component1::Service1
│   │   │   │   ├── service2.rb           # contains Component1::Service2
```

And that's only for a single pack! As your modular monolith grows, you'll likely have dozens (maybe you'll have 
hundreds) of packs. That's a lot of "namespace" directories that aren't adding a lot of value. You already 
know the namespace of those classes in a strongly namespaced pack -- it's the pack name -- can Zeitwerk know it, too?

This gem configures the Rails 7 autoloader so that most subdirectories under your strongly namespaced component's `app` directory are 
automatically associated with the namespace. 

## Installation

Install the gem and add to the application's Gemfile by executing:

    $ bundle add automatic_namespaces

If bundler is not being used to manage dependencies, install the gem by executing:

    $ gem install automatic_namespaces

## Usage

Given the `package.yml` of a strongly namespaced pack:

```yml
enforce_dependencies: true
enforce_privacy: true
public_path: app/public/
dependencies:
 - "packs/components/core_ui"
 - "packs/components/core_ext"
 - "packs/components/us_states"
 - "packs/subsystems/products"
 - "packs/subsystems/inventory"
metadata:
```

modify the metadata to opt into automatic namespacing:

```yml
metadata:
 automatic_pack_namespace: true
```

Now restructure your files to remove the extra namespace directories under `app`. Note that some directories do not 
generally contain namespaced classes. These are exempted from `automatic_namespaces`:

* assets
* helpers
* javascript
* views

Additional directories can be excluded by adding them to the `automatic_pack_namespace_exclusions` key in your 
`package.yml` file. This is useful if you require files in your pack that sit outside of your packs namespace:

```yml
metadata:
  automatic_pack_namespace: true
  automatic_pack_namespace_exclusions:
    - app/policies # Exclude pundit policies
    - app/admin # Exclude active admin definition files
```

If your package / namespace name requires ActiveSupport inflections, you will probably need to tell `automatic_namespaces`
what the correct namespace name should be in that package:

```yml
# packs/shoes_ui/package.yml
metadata:
  automatic_pack_namespace: true
  namespace_override: ShoesUI
```

This is necessary because `automatic_namespaces` works by modifying the autoloader paths, which has to 
happen during Rails application initialization; but the inflector is not available for use then.

If you would like to use your own file layout conventions for packs (i.e. not `app/*`) you can specify 
your own glob by using `autoload_glob` to append the glob to the folder containing package.yml. This defaults
to `'/**/app/*'` 

```yml
metadata:
  # Put the folder containing package.yml as the root for the autoloader.
  autoload_glob: ''
```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bundle install` to install dependencies. Then, run `rspec` to run the tests. 

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and the created tag, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
